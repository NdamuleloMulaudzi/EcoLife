                An easy way to reduce your carbon footprint is to buy loclly
                produced products. When you purchase local stuff, instead of
                buying products that were shipped from far away, you are
                actually supporting local brands. And also, processed goods take
                a lot of energy, first for processing and then, the fuel
                consumption in transportation

                As responsible citizens of the world. It is our duty to do out a
                bit to take care of it. You may think you won't make much of
                difference, especially if most other people aren't too pressed
                about the Earth. But as they say, every drop makes the ocean.
                And in much the same way, we must strive to give back to Mother
                Nature as best as we can, in our own small ways.
